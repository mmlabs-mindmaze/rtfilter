      This package provides a library written in C implementing realtime digital
      filtering functions for multichannel signals (i.e. filtering multiple
      signals with the same filter).
      The core library implements FIR and IIR filtering for float and double
      data type. Additional functions are also provided to design few usual
      filters: Butterworth, Chebyshev, windowed sinc...
