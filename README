                               RTFILTER



Presentation
============

This package provides a library written in C implementing realtime digital
filtering functions for multichannel signals (i.e. filtering multiple
signals with the same filter). The core library implements FIR and IIR
filtering for float and double data type. Additional functions are also
provided to design few usual filters: Butterworth, Chebyshev, windowed
sinc...

In addition, the filter functions have been especially optimized for
multichannel signals. If data allows it (and if possible with the
compilation flags used), the library automatically switch to optimized SIMD
(Single Instruction Multiple Data) code, allowing to reduce by 3~4 the time
spent in processing the data.


Supported platforms
===================

Any POSIX platform and windows. The SIMD code operating on real data is
possible if the host CPU supports SSE2 instruction sets (Intel pentium4,
AMD k8 or later processors support SSE2), and SIMD code operating on complex
data is possible if host CPU supports SSE3.


Compilation
===========

This library is organized as a GNU package and can be compiled and
installed in the same way (see INSTALL file for further information).

In order the library to be compiled with SIMD version of the filter
functions, make sure you specify the correct architecture (add 
-march=target_arch to CFLAGS with gcc) or enable the necessary instruction
set (add -msse2 or -msse3 to CFLAGS with gcc)

On x86 family platform, the 387 floating point coprocessor is well known to
introduce some numerical error whose symptoms may be seen in the filter
design functions. Therefore it is recommended to generate floating point
code using SSE instructions whenever possible. By default, the configure
script will specify the necessary compiler flags if gcc is used. If you use
another compiler you may need set manually CFLAGS at the invokation of the
configure script (see your compiler documentation to know which flags should
be passed).
